# 🎯 Goal: Become an AI System Architect (toward AGI)

## 🧠 Phase 1: Solidify Core ML/AI Knowledge _(3–4 months)_

_You're already pursuing a master's, so this will help structure your self-study & daily ML doses._

### 📚 Deep Theory
- Probability, statistics, linear algebra, optimization
- Algorithms & complexity (tie in your DSA skills!)
- Numerical methods (matrix calculus, gradient descent, etc.)

### 📘 Must-Learn ML Topics
- Supervised & Unsupervised Learning
- Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVM, kNN
- Ensemble Methods (Boosting, Bagging)

### 👨‍💻 Suggested Action
- Implement models from scratch (no libraries)
- Use Kaggle & fast.ai for structured, competitive practice
- Daily review from books like _“Hands-On ML with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow”_

---

## 🧠 Phase 2: Deep Learning & LLM Foundation _(4–5 months)_

### 💡 Core Concepts
- Neural networks, CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, Attention
- Transformers, GPT architecture
- Embeddings, Positional Encoding, Masking

### 🧰 Tools
- PyTorch (your go-to!) or TensorFlow
- HuggingFace Transformers
- Weights & Biases for experiment tracking

### 👨‍💻 Projects
- Train a Transformer from scratch on a toy dataset
- Build your own mini-ChatGPT using HuggingFace
- Fine-tune LLMs on custom datasets (e.g., code generation, document summarization)

---

## 🧠 Phase 3: Systems Engineering for AI _(3 months)_

_You’ll move from being a “model builder” to a “system thinker.”_

### 📦 Learn About
- Model Serving (ONNX, TorchServe, Triton)
- Prompt engineering & APIs (OpenAI, Cohere, Mistral, LLaMA)
- Scaling models: data pipelines, GPU clusters, distributed training

### 👨‍💻 Real-World Work
- Build a full-stack AI app: train → serve → deploy
- Use LangChain or LlamaIndex for RAG-based systems
- Explore vector DBs: Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant

---

## 🧠 Phase 4: AGI & Research Track _(Ongoing, advanced)_

### 🧬 Key Areas
- RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback)
- Agentic systems (AutoGPT, BabyAGI)
- Interpretability, Alignment & Safety
- Meta-learning & continual learning

### 🧪 Get into Research
- Read papers weekly (use arXiv-sanity, Papers with Code)
- Try replicating OpenAI/DeepMind/Anthropic papers
- Contribute to open-source AGI initiatives

## ⚙️ Weekly Plan (10–20 mins daily)

| Day  | Focus                             |
|------|------------------------------------|
| Mon  | Theory (ML/Deep Learning)         |
| Tue  | Coding from scratch               |
| Wed  | Read a recent paper               |
| Thu  | Reproduce one model               |
| Fri  | Build/fix an AI micro-project     |
| Sat  | Explore AGI tools or alignment work |
| Sun  | Review + build something fun (e.g., emoji-to-movie GPT) |
